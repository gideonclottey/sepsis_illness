    "Objective:\n",
    "The goal is to predict whether ICU patients will develop sepsis (Sepssis) based on clinical and demographic attributes. This prediction will assist medical professionals in identifying high-risk patients early, allowing timely interventions to reduce mortality and improve patient outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Drivers:\n",
    "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition requiring early detection. By leveraging patient data such as blood work results, blood pressure, BMI, age, and insurance status, we aim to create a model that predicts sepsis risk with high accuracy and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Business Goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk Stratification: Prioritize patients based on their likelihood of developing sepsis.\n",
    "Early Intervention: Enable proactive medical care for high-risk patients.\n",
    "Resource Optimization: Allocate ICU resources efficiently by targeting high-risk cases.\n",
    "Patient Outcomes: Improve survival rates and reduce ICU stay duration by preventing severe sepsis cases.\n",
    "Impact:\n",
    "This solution could enhance healthcare decision-making, reduce costs associated with complications, and ultimately save lives."
